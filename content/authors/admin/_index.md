I am a Data Scientist currently working [@Howz](https://www.howz.com), we are trying to revolutionise elderly care by allowing them to live independently for longer. I spend most days analysing time series data and finding new innovative ways to extract more information, my main projects include 'The Scorecard' - a simple, portable view allowing medical professionals to make informed decisions. 'Night Activity' - most elderly people are up at night, but what is an anomaly?. Prior to Howz, I gained my MSc at [Lancaster](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk) and worked with [Gousto](https://www.gousto.co.uk) to examine their factory throughput.

Check out some of my publications or articles!
