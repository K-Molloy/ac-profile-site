abstract: Using  various  dimensionality  reduction  algorithms;PCA,  PFA  and  a  custom  PCA  L1-Norm,  to  reduce  a  largedataset  to  perform  unsupervised  clustering  and  compare  theperformance of various clustering methods, including analysis ofthe  optimal  number  of  clusters  and  scoring  of  clustering.  Thenclassifying  the  dataset  using  SVM  as  well  as  using  the  Auto-Sklearn  library  to  efficiently  evaluate  the  hyperparameters  forthe problem including  creating an MLP extension  and testing a zeroconf  approach.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: Clustering swiss weather data using various library techniques from sklearn, AutoML, as well as some custom attempts
